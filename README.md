# **Analyzing-customer-churn-in-Power-BI**

**This project analyzes customer churn data to discover why customers are churning**

## **Churn definition**
The churn rate, also known as the rate of attrition or customer churn, is the rate at which customers stop
doing business with an entity. As a result the revenue of company will not increase if existing customers are leaving the company and
get new customers is more expensive and hard that keep currently customers, so reduce churn is a priority for many companies.

One way to calculate churn can be defined by the formula:
Churn rate = customers lost / total number of customers

Understand churn help companies to:
- Measure competitiveness.
- Provides clarity of the type of customer that is leaving.

## **Part 1**

### Prepossessing
- Convert labels (yes, no) to 1 and 0
- Calculate the sum of churn customers and its rate

### Visualizations
- Define a bar chart to investigate the **different reasons why customers churned**
- Define a map of **churn rate by state**

### Insights discovered
- The churn rate for the database used is **(~27%)**
- The most reason of churn is related to competitors **(~45%)**
- In California the churn rate is abnormally hight **(>60%)**

## **Part 2**
Analyzing the different demographic fields
- As the age increase the churn rate increase too
- Grouping customers we can notice that from group 2 to 6 the churn rate descrease and the group 6 has the lowest churn rate
- Comparing annual and monthly contracts, it is also clear that customers with a monthly contract have a much higher churn rate **(46.29%)** than customers with an annual contract **(6.62%)**.
- Analyzing the churn rate from the point of view of average data consumption (GB) with downloads, we noticed that the churn rate is quite pronounced in the group of customers whose average consumption is 5 GB per month and have the Unlimited Data Plan compared to with those who don't.
- International calls vs churn rate: analyzing the data of customers who make international calls, we found that in percentage terms **72%** of customers do not have a plan and, therefore, this finding makes them potential clients for the new promotionof the international plan.

## **Part 3**
